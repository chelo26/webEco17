I've added a table similar to the article "RTB benchmarking with iPinYou Dataset". Also, I've added my strategies for constant and random bids. I might have misunderstood the question so please feel free to tell me if i was wrong regarding this question.

Thanks Shafik, however as we were discussing with Ulises, from what I discussed with the professor and from the information in the papers first we need to estimate the CTR, and then propose a bidprice. The logic behind this is that it doesn't matter if you win or loss the bid if the person on the other side will not click on the add. 

I added a file that preprocess the data according to the paper, please take a look and let me know what you think about. I spend all the afternoon making this file and there is still a lot to do, so it would be helpful if we can discuss about how to make cooperation more efficient. It would also help if you guys read the papers mentioned on the assignment, so then we don't do things wrong or completely random. thanks.

Thanks for your feedback. I've contaced the TA's and the main points are :
* one constant value for bidding for all the impressions ( not like the papers )
* we can conisder the click only and we can consider all the impressions
* the one remaining question is whether we are a player in the auction or we are making a strategy because that could change a lot of things
- I'll forward the email to you guys.

Great, thanks for the update ! I also had some words with the TA, sent you the e-mail. I uploaded 2 files one that extracts the features and the other makes the model, so far it uses one advertiser but it should be ok to deal all of them. However already with one it takes time to train. Let's see tomorrow!
